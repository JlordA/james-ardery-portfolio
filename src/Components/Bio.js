          Hello World! My name is James Ardery and I am a budding software
          engineer with a background in music and art composition. I was born in
          1984 and am originally from Louisville Kentucky. I have spent the last
          13 years living in Brooklyn. I worked for many of those years in event
          production as a booking agent and sound engineer. I also spent many
          months on the road as a touring musician. Most recently I completed a
          software engineering bootcamp at Flatiron School that focused on the
          stacks React, Javascript, and Ruby on Rails. The apps built during my
          time at Flatrion listed in the tech section. Previous art and music
          projects can be found in the music section. If you like anything you
          see here or just want to chat contact me!
