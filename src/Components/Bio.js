          Hello World! My name is James Ardery and I am a budding software
          engineer with a background in music and art composition. I was born in
          1984 and am originally from Louisville Kentucky. I have spent the last
          13 years living in Brooklyn. I worked for many of those years in event
          production as a booking agent and sound engineer. I also spent many
          months on the road as a touring musician. Most recently completed a
          software engineering bootcamp at Flatiron School that focused on
          Rails, Javascript, and React. The apps built during my time at Flatrion
          listed in the tech section.

          James Ardery (b. 1984) is a composer and sometimes-visual artist whose
          work focuses on behavioral repetition and its trappings and freedoms.
          Percussion, feedback, electronic synthesis, tape loops, and guitar are
          typical in his compositions. From 2010 to 2016 Ardery worked primarily
          writing and recording music in the band Lushes. With this project he
          toured both the U.S. and Europe many times and produced two full
          length releases on the Los Angles based label Felte Records. In
          addition to Lushes he worked as a curator for music venues in
          Manhattan as well as the fertile Brooklyn DIY scene. In 2010 Ardery
          co-founded the semi-annual music festival Cropped Out with childhood
          friend and artist Ryan Davis in his hometown of Louisville Kentucky.
          Cropped Out has hosted notable artists such as Sun Ra Arkestra, Susan
          Alcorn, Lil B, Circuit Des Yeux, Jandek, Anthony Braxton, Jana Rush,
          and $hit and $hine. In 2018 the Festival celebrated its 7th birthday.
          Over the summer of 2017 Ardery was an artist in residence with the
          Rare Air neon gallery located on Governors Island NYC. During the
          residency Ardery produced the album "The Magic Roundabout" (Cowboy
          Turns) as well as the visual art piece "Now Lie in It" for the
          residency group show. He is self-taught and has no educational
          background in any of these mediums. Buyer (nothing for sale) beware.
